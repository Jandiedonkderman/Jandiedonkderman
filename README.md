Hi, I’m @Jandiedonkerman

👀 I’m interested in cloud systems engineering, automation with PowerShell, philosophical discussions on technology and existence, and exploring new tools and methodologies.

🌱 I’m currently learning more PowerShell, more cloud, more everything and integrating personal and professional workflows.

💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything right now, my work-life balance is broken. 🤣

😄 Pronouns: Lol/Lol

🥓 Fun fact: Bacon is the best.
